# Final Year Project: Person-Following Robot

This repository contains my final year project at King's College London: a person-following robot with the following capabilities:

- **Person following:** The robot follows a specific person.
- **Person lock:** The robot remains focused on the person being followed, even when other people enter its field of view.
- **Search behavior:** The robot initiates a search when the person leaves its field of view.

This project makes use of:

- TIAGo as the robot 
- Yolov8 for human recognition.
- MoveBase for robot path planning.
