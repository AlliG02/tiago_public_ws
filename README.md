<h1>Person-Following Robot</h1> 

This repository contains my final year project at King's College London. A person-following robot capable of:

- person following.
- person lock. Stays focused on person being followed when other people enter the field of view.
- search behaviour when person leaves the field of view.

This project makes use of:

- TIAGo as the robot 
- Yolov8 for human recognition.
- MoveBase for robot path planning.
